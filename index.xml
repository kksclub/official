      <description>Fresh Brands If your brand has lower awareness in China and intent to touch base with China market In the KFC Model the merchant can put the product in KKS overseas warehouses. This is relatively an easier model to test new products in the market. The merchant will take responsibility to deliver the products into the KFC warehouse where from all aspects of delivery will be handled by KKS. Hence businesses which have low brand awareness but intent to test China market could use this model.</description>
